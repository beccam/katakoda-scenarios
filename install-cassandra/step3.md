# Start the Cassandra daemon

Navigate into the cassandra directory:

`cd apache-cassandra-4.0-alpha3/bin`{{execute}}

Run the following command to start your server

`cassandra`{{execute}}

You could also use the `-f` switch to tell Cassandra to stay in the foreground instead of running as a background process. In either case, the logs will append to the _system.log_ file.
