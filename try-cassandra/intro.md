Cassandra Query Language (CQL) offers a model close to SQL in the sense that data is put in tables containing rows of columns. For that reason, when used in this scenario, these terms (tables, rows and columns) have the same definition than they have in SQL. Isn't that helpful?

In this scenario, you will learn the essential CQL commands needed to effectively write and read data to Apache Cassandra, using the included **cqlsh** tool.
