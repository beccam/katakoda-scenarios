Now try the command `DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;`

Here you can see all of keyspaces that have been created in the Cassandra cluster. There are 5 other keyspaces aside from the *demo* keyspace that you created, all of them starting with **system**. These are automatically created by the database and are used as the data dictionary for the cluster.
