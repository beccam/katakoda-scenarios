The DataStax Node.js Driver for Apache Cassandra allows us to interact with Cassandra in the Node.js programming language. This short scenario will walk you through using CRUD operations against your instance through the Node.js Driver.

Wait for Cassandra to finish starting up, this shouldn't take long! When it is finished, start the REPL:

`node`{{execute}}
