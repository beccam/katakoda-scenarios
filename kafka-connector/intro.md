DataStax Apache Kafka™ Connector is installed in the Kafka Connect framework, and synchronizes records from a Kafka topic with table rows Apache Cassandra 2.1+, DataStax Enterprise 4.7+ and DataStax Astra cloud databases.

Since a lot of our customers already use Apache Kafka with datstax enterprise, the Datastax drivers team set out to create a connector using all the best practices for writing data to our product.

The result is a connector that’s simple to use, feature rich, highly performant, and a real time-saver.
