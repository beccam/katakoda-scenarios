In this scenario, you will:

* Connect to an Apache Cassandra™ instance with the DataStax Java driver
* Use the driver to execute CQL statements against Apache Cassandra™ that do the following:
  * Insert a user into a table
  * Select that user back out
  * Update the user's age
  * Delete the user from the table
* Process CQL query results programmatically
