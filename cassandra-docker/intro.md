# Running Cassandra in Docker

This scenario is based on "Chapter 3: Installing Cassandra" from the O'Reilly book "Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition" by Jeff Carpenter and Eben Hewitt.
 
Over the past few years, containers have become a very popular alternative to full machine virtualization for deployment of applications and supporting infrastructure such as databases.

Given the high popularity of Docker and its image format, the Apache project has begun supporting official Docker images of Cassandra.

In this scenario, you'll download the official Cassandra image from Docker Hub and use it to start Cassandra clusters.
