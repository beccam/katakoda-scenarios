# Types in the Cassandra Query Language (CQL)

This scenario is based on "Chapter 4: The Cassandra Query Language" from the O'Reilly book "Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition" by Jeff Carpenter and Eben Hewitt.

In the scenario "Get to Know CQL" you can learn some of the basic operations in CQL such as creating keyspaces and tables and reading, writing and deleting data from those tables.

Each column in a Cassandra table is of a specified type. In this scenario, you'll learn about the various types that are available to you for representing values.

CQL supports a variety of character and numeric types, collections, and user-defined types. We'll describe these data types and provide some examples of how you use them.
