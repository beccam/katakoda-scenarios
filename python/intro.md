In this scenario, you will:

* Connect to an Apache Cassandra™ instance with the DataStax Python driver
* Use the driver to execute CQL statements against Apache Cassandra™ to do the following:
** Insert a user into a table
** Select that user back out
** Update the user's age
** Delete the user from the table 
* We will process CQL query results programmatically
