# Get to know the Cassandra Query Language (CQL)

This scenario is based on "Chapter 3: Installing Cassandra" from the O'Reilly book "Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition" by Jeff Carpenter and Eben Hewitt.
 
In this scenario, we'll get to know CQL by using Cassandra's command line shell `cqlsh`.

We've already installed Cassandra on this instance for you and started a running instance, now all that remains is to start the shell, and you'll be ready to learn some basic commands:

`./apache-cassandra-4.0-alpha3/bin/cqlsh`{{execute}}
